I have wrote three happy path for UI testing.

To conduct the UI testing:

Please firstly run `yarn install` at `./frontend` and `./backend` folder

Then, run `yarn start` at both folders in two terminals

Then, run `yarn cypress open` at `./frontend` folder

Finally, run the file named `index.js` in the cypress GUI.
